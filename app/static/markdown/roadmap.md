## Current Roadmap

Last update: August 5, 2023

### Bugs Found

- ðŸ”² If the user is writing a reply and the token expires behind the scenes, the application, instead of trying to renew the token, will spit them out to the /login page to get that token refreshed. This means the user loses data they have entered. Annoying.   

### Bugs Quashed

- âœ… Anonymous Users (who cannot vote) have shown that they *have* voted - visual bug. -> Anonymous users now cannot vote and are not shown otherwise. Voting has a loading spinner to indicate processing time. 
- âœ… Markdown does not render properly in Post Summary View. -> Markdown now renders properly in post-summary view. 
- âœ… When a token expires, it doesn't notify the user. It should automatically refresh instead of kicking the user back to the /login route. 
  - *This bug was caused because "remix-superfly", set the auto refresh and persist values manually to 'false', overriding the default of 'true'. (Cue the Simpsons meme: "Here's your problem, someone set this thing to evil.")*
- âœ… Elements now have loading spinners to indicate status (and prevent confusion as to whether the user needs to reload the page or click again.)
  - âœ… Voting now has a loading spinner
  - âœ… Creating communities now has a loading spinner
  - âœ… Creating posts now has a loading spinner 
  - âœ… Creating comments now has a loading spinner 
  - âœ… Creating replies now has a loading spinner 
  - âœ… Subscribing now has a loading spinner 


### Completed:

- âœ… Signup and Login via Email/Password (basic, happy path)
- âœ… Signed in users can create communities.
- âœ… Signed in users can create posts on communities
- âœ… Signed in users can create comments on posts
- âœ… Signed in users can create comments on other comments
- âœ… Authors (but not moderators) can now edit posts.
- âœ… Authors and moderators can now delete posts.
- âœ… Login via username and password
- âœ… Login via Google Auth (and should be simple to do other Oauth providers)
- âœ… When a user logs in for the first time with GoogleAuth, they are prompted to choose a username so that they can contribute on the site. 
- âœ… Created separate Supabase projects for production and development - a "Kick the tires" methodology. The sooner I can get real people to look at the bugs on the site, the sooner I can continue working on them, so I'm creating two DBs, one for production and one for development.
- âœ… Reconnect previously written functionality using new Auth provider. (Long story short: this was originally written using FusionAuth as the auth provider but Supabase was just a better solution. Rather than try to add Supabase to the existing repo, it was just quicker to create a new Remix Supa-Fly project.)
- âœ… A moderation tool to ban/unban users from communities
- âœ… Users can vote on posts, and posts display how the user voted, as well as the total of all votes
- âœ… Users can vote on comments, and comments display how the user voted, as well as the total of all votes
- âœ… Banned users cannot create new posts, cannot create new comments, in communities where they are banned
- âœ… Users can reset their password via 'forgot-password'
- âœ… Authors can edit or delete comments
- âœ… Moderators can delete, but not edit comments.
- âœ… If a comment with children is deleted, the comment is marked as deleted, but not removed in the comment hierarchy.
- âœ… Users can now add images to their posts via URLs. (but not yet edit them.)

### What's *immediately* next;

- ðŸ”² As a post author, I would like to be able to edit my images as well as my text.

### What's next? 

- ðŸ”² As a site owner, I would like to require email confirmation for signups before a user can post. 
- ðŸ”² As a user, I would like to place "Reactions" (like Slashdot moderation) for posts and comments
- ðŸ”² As a user, I would like to be able to tag posts and comments with arbitrary hashes.
- ðŸ”² As a user *making a post* (but not a comment), I would like to be able to embed youtube videos. 
  - This will take the form of URLs, rather than an upload service. I.e., users can upload to Imgur or another host and link the image to be shown. 
- ðŸ”² As a user *creating a community*, I would like to be able to *upload* a header image to be stored on our servers. 
- ðŸ”² As a visitor, I'd like to see a list of most popular communities by page loads, subscribers, posts, comments, etc.
- ðŸ”² As a visitor, I'd like to see a list of most posts (by votes, by visits, by 'hotness', most recent, etc.)
- ðŸ”² As a developer, I'd like Unit & Integration testing. (Normally I do TDD first, but I needed to get used to the Remix environment and see what features are feasible.)
- ðŸ”² As a user, I'd like to be able to get a share menu for posts (a popover) which allows me to copy a link to the clipboard or to have a downloadable HTML code that I can embed in a webpage.
- ðŸ”² As a user, I would like to upload avatars, images, community header images, etc. to bucket storage on supabase and have them displayed.
- ðŸ”² As a moderator, I would like to 'lock' posts so that no more edits or comments can be made. 
- ðŸ”² As a moderator, I would like to 'sticky' posts so that they always show up at the top of the page. 
- ðŸ”² As a user, I would like to add a direct message system. 
- ðŸ”² As a myself, I would like to have a blog system that uses markdown so that I can have a development blog.  
### What is being postponed?

- ðŸ”² I want to provide header images for communities, but it might make sense to create the community first before the header image is added. Thus, any moderator may change the community header, community headers will have filenames based on the community, etc.
  - ðŸ”² I may be setting up Supabase storage for this information, though I'm worried about bandwidth, especially as we pre-scale, and may limit header images to 540x540 pixels and 100kb (even perhaps using server-side code to resize and recompress images.  )
- ðŸ”² Error boundaries need to be configured and prettified.
