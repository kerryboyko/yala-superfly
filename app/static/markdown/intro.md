# YALA: Yet Another Link Aggregator

Not sure what to do first?

1. Create your account (or login).
2. Click on the Create New Community button (or [this link](/create-community))
3. Click on the Create New Post button, and add a post.

That's it! You just created a community and posted on YALA!

## Ready for Users!

Howdy. YALA is in super-early alpha stage. You'll find items marked as "FIXME" or hit with a strikethrough. These are placeholders to indicate that the functionality is not yet developed, but it will be soon.

In the meantime, feel free to go around and kick the tires! Try:

- [/c/yaladev - Yala Development Community](/c/yaladev)
- [/allposts - a list of all the posts (so far)](/allposts)
- [/allcommunities - a list of all the communities (so far)](/allcommunities)
